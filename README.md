# Math Problem Generator

A math problem generator for single & multivariate calculus, with topic expanison possible. Options for generation include selectable topics, number of problems, and difficulty. Support for solutions in consideration.
Written in Python 3.7.2

## Next Additions:

1. Finish support for other expressions, including closeform (trigonometric, logarithmic) and mathematical (deriviatives, integration).

2. Complete main program

3. Build translation to Latex, MathJax

4. Consider support for solutions
